 BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "Brief History"
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Occident in Flames"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "'We'll be remembered as the generation that destroyed all this.' - Iouliana Erdemir, to Evgenia Exteberria"
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 MRT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Rishma Sharqi has transformed the absolutist monarchy she inherited into a new Communist state-- not a meek communal democracy in the Byzantine vein, but a hardline Mullerist dictatorship with the strength to stamp out the bourgeoisie of Western India.\n\n Politicans in Byzantion and Edinburgh shake their head, but Marathas has the power to make itself indispensible to the RRP-- if it desires. On the other hand, the liberal government of Hindustan falters and Indian unification tantalizes."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The 1920s were a whirlwind of change for what was once the Kingdom of France. Valeria Imperatrix was swept to power, the slogan 'Begin again!' on her lips; she savaged Germany in a lightning war and brought victory to France; she died and began again and lived. Valeria Postuma broods in Paris, knowing that revenge against the NGF is just the beginning. \n\nThe road to the conquest of Europe leads straight through Byzantium-- barbarians squatting on Rome's rightful inheritance. They will fall, and the Near West will begin again."
 AYI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The victors of the First Great War became the vanquished of the second when Britain and Byzantium intervened to stop Ayiti from dominating Avalon once and for all. \n\nThe new Ayiti Commune established by the victorious RRP has brought prosperity but not unity. Its tribune works towards a future as a full member of the Red Rose Pact-- but is it the future the people want?"
 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Silver rules the world, and all silver flows to China. With the Empress a virtual prisoner in the Forbidden City, Zhang Zhulin and his consortium of pangalist corporations have all the resources of the Ming Empire at their disposal. \n\nCommunists and fascists fight over the ruins of the past. Sickly liberal republics cling to their scraps. The future belongs to the bold, and few are as bold as the pangalist ideologues of China."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japan, the world's first modern republic and its foremost bastion of liberalism, was dealt a humiliating setback when Somalia and the Ming Empire ejected them from much of their sphere of influence following a disastrous war in the Near West. \n\nThe Allies, under Japan's leadership, have circled their wagons, preparing for an existential war against the Pangalist WPO. Will the tricolors fly in the second half of the 20th century? Or will the Republic be devoured by its children?"
 SOM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Somalia has shaken off the tyranny of its Lord Protector and restored the patrician Republic. A fruitful alliance with China has already led to one smashing victory against the Japanese and their allies. \n\nThe patricians of the Republic expect a second one to follow, should war break out again. But, to the north, storm clouds gather, and threaten to take the whole Near West down with them."
 BYZ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The leader of the Red Rose Pact, the home of the Revolution, the inheritors of the Roman Empire, no matter how much they deny it. \n\nAfter victory in the Second Great War, the bleak prospect of a third looms, not in far-off Avalon, but as a conflagration which threatens to devour the Near West. Will Iouliana Erdemir's worker's paradise endure, or will the dream die beneath Valerian boots? Raise the red flags, unite the workers, defend the City of the World's Desire."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "War between the continent-spanning Great Powers seems all but inevitable. Will it be an opportunity for the other nations of the world to rise in their place? Or are they nothing but grist for the mill of Empire?"
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg - Unmodded"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Don't select this bookmark! It's unmodded because doing both bookmarks really isn't worth the effort and the LP will pick up at 1936 anyway. - Regards, Team Byzmod"
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
